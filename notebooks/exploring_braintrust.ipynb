    "\n",
    "This notebook aims to explore Evaluation APIs offered by [Braintrust](https://docs.perplexity.ai/). \n",
    "\n",
    "[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/GiacomoMeloni/ExploringLLMs/blob/main/notebooks/exploring_braintrust.ipynb)\n",

    "## ü§î  **About Braintrust**\n",
    "Braintrust is a service that helps you evaluate your LLM app, mainly focused on production-quality applications. It is possible to leverage on the [Python SDK](https://www.braintrustdata.com/docs/libs/python) as well as on the [Node library](https://www.braintrustdata.com/docs/libs/nodejs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluations are crucial in AI, and accuracy deserves as much focus as speed in developing LLM-based applications. Braintrust's evaluation-driven approach enhances product reliability and quality, accelerating the testing process. This service allows teams to share evaluation datasets, with also versioning features; define their own evaluation metrics or leveraging in predefined metrics offered by the framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîß **Get Started**\n",
    "To access to `Braintrust` Dashboard an API key is needed. You can easily access through the \"Settings\" page of active account (is needed to sign up on the platform) and click on \"API Keys\" to generate a new key for your projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ö†Ô∏è **Remember API Keys will be visibile only one time, after that they won't be displayed again! So keep it safe once created!**\n",
    "‚ÑπÔ∏è **The API key needs to be stored as environment variable with the following name `BRAINTRUST_API_KEY`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Another feature that needs mention is that you need to update a GenAI Provider API Key (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) to leverage on some model-based metrics that we will cover later on this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ÑπÔ∏è **There is no need to have an enterprise plan to leverage on basic evaluation features offered by the library**\n",
    "‚ÑπÔ∏è **For more details on API key sey-up refer to [Create an API key](https://www.braintrustdata.com/docs#create-an-api-key) guide section**"
